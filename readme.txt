== Description ==

This is a simple Wordpress plugin aimed at giving credit where credit is due.

The plugin inserts an XHTML list into any post/page through a shortcode. If you're into customization, you can specify a format argument and indicate the exact output you are after. There's also an option to display inactive plugins as well.

Key features include...

* A simple template system allows you to format how you'd like the plugin information to be shown
* Template tags are available for automatically linked items as well as simple text
* Choose from a number of pieces of plugin data to be output
* Display inactive plugins as well as active plugins if you wish
* Output is cached to provide a super-quick response
* A separate shortcode allows you to display how many plugins you have!

Thanks to [Matej Nastran](http://matej.nastran.net/)'s [My plugins](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/my-plugins/), from which *Plugins list* was initially derived.

Please visit the [Github page](https://github.com/dartiss/plugins-list "Github") for the latest code development, planned enhancements and known issues.

== Instructions on use ==

To get a list of the plugins that are installed and activated in your website, insert the following into any post or page:

`<ul>[plugins_list]</ul>`

You can customise the output specifying the `format` argument and a number of pre-defined `tags`. Here's an example:

`[plugins_list format="{{LinkedTitle}} - {{LinkedAuthor}}</br>"]`

The tags are: `Title`, `PluginURI`, `Author` ,`AuthorURI`, `Version`, `Description`, `LinkedTitle`, `LinkedAuthor`. All are defined within double braces.

If you want to list also the plug-ins you have installed but are not using, here's the formula:

`<ul>[plugins_list show_inactive=true]</ul>`

The plugins list can be freely styled with css, just place any *class* or *id* attribute on the `format` string, or on the elements surrounding it.

By default links will be followed but you can make these "nofollow" by simply adding the parameter of `nofollow=true`. For example...

`<ul>[plugins_list nofollow=true]</ul>`

You can also specify the link target too. For example...

`<ul>[plugins_list target="_blank"]</ul>`

Finally, want so sort the output by author and not plugin name? Just use the parameter `by_author`. For example...

`<ul>[plugins_list by_author=true]</ul>`

== Using HTML ==

If you wish to put HTML in your format then you can. However, this can cause havoc in the Visual editor and even causes extra characters to be passed into the output (rogue paragraph tags, for instance). I therefore highly recommend that, if you wish to add HTML, use double braces instead of < and > around your HTML tags - this plugin will correct this before output but it means the visual editor doesn't try and interpret the HTML.

For example...

`<ul>[plugins_list format="{{li}}{{LinkedTitle}} - {{LinkedAuthor}}{{/li}}"]</ul>`

The characters will be corrected upon output and you will get a lovely, bulleted, un-ordered list as output.

== Cache ==

By default your plugin list will be cached for 5 minutes, ensuring that performance is impacted as little as possible. Use the parameter `cache` to change the number of minutes. Set this to false to switch off caching.

For example...

`<ul>[plugins_list cache=60]</ul>`

This will cache for 1 hour. The following will switch the cache off...

`<ul>[plugins_list cache=false]</ul>`

== Plugin Count ==

A shortcode also exists to allow you to display the number of plugins that you have. Simply add `[plugins_number]` to your post or page and it will return the number of active plugins.

To display the number of active AND inactive plugins use `[plugins_number inactive=true]`. You can also display the number of inactive plugins by specifying `[plugins_number inactive=true active=false]`.

As with the other shortcode results will be cached by default. To change the number of hours simply use the `cache` parameter. Set it to `false` to switch off caching. For example...

`[plugins_number inactive=true cache=2]`

== Reviews & Mentions ==

[A default WP credit page would be kind of neat](http://halfelf.org/2012/penguins-just-gotta-be-me/#comments "PENGUINS JUST GOTTA BE ME")

== Installation ==

Plugins List can be found and installed via the Plugin menu within WordPress administration (Plugins -> Add New). Alternatively, it can be downloaded from WordPress.org and installed manually...

1. Upload the entire `plugins-list` folder to your `wp-content/plugins/` directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress administration.

Voila! It's ready to go.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= You've changed from using hashes to double braces for tags - help! =

Using double braces (i.e. {{ and {{) for templates is pretty standard so something I wanted to move towards. However, I don't want existing usage to break so I'm supporting both the old and new methods - however, I'm not documenting the old method so my hope is for people to move towards usage of double braces.
